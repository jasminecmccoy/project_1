        <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>I focus mostly on business and lifestyle photography, though I have dabbled in wedding and sports photography. 
          The thing I love about photography is making people see themselves in a way they never have before. </p>

        <h2>Exploring</h2>
        <p>Although I don't get to do it frequently, I have so much fun putting my hiking boots on and exploring all of the great
          things my area has to offer. </p>

        <h2>Business</h2>
        <p>Business is always something that has intrigued me. For as long as I can remember I have wanted to own my own business and have
        looked up to those who have beat the odds and started a business from the ground up.</p>

        <h2>Animals</h2>
        <p>My Husky, Millie, is my pride and joy, but I do love all animals. Something about how intelligent and adaptable animals can be
          has always interested me. </p>
