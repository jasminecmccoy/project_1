Background
I’m a highly motivated aspiring web designer and entrepreneur. I enjoy taking things and building them from the ground up.
I’ve worked mostly in the field of Optometry and Optometry research. This field has given me extensive experience with attention to detail and organization.
I became interested in web design slowly as I grew up around it all of my life. I was introduced to the field by my mother who is a front-end web developer. I quickly
realized how perfectly web design lines up with my skills and interests. 

Goals
I want to master the process of building websites by increasing my knowledge of, and building my skills in
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
And then continue on to master the process of building full web applications by learning more advanced skills and concepts such as
JavaScript Framework
SASS/SCSS
API Consumption
JavaScript Build Tools
Git/Github
SQL

I’d like to start my own business and establish a notable clientele while continuing to learn and build my skills with every project.



Interests: 

Photography
I focus mostly on business and lifestyle photography, though I have dabbled in wedding and sports photography. The thing I love about photography is making people see themselves in a way they never have before. 

Exploring
Although I don't get to do it frequently, I have so much fun putting my hiking boots on and exploring all of the great things my area has to offer.

Business
Business is always something that has intrigued me. For as long as I can remember I have wanted to own my own business and have looked up to those who have beat the odds and started a business from the ground up.

Animals
My Husky, Millie, is my pride and joy, but I do love all animals. Something about how intelligent and adaptable animals can be has always interested me.
